/**
 * Vector3.ts
 *
 * This module defines a 3D vector class with common vector operations.
 * The class is designed with immutability in mind for arithmetic methods (which return new Vector3 instances)
 * except for the `copy` method, which mutates the target vector.
 *
 * Methods provided include: add, subtract, multiplyScalar, divideScalar,
 * dot (dot product), cross (cross product), magnitude, normalize, distanceTo, clone, copy, set,
 * and rotateAroundAxis (which uses Rodrigues' rotation formula).
