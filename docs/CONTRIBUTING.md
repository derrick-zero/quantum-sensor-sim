## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior to [derrick.geiszler@gmail.com](mailto:derrick.geiszler@gmail.com).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- **Search Before Reporting:**
  Please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/derrick-zero/quantum-sensor-sim/issues) for similar issues before creating a new bug report.
- **Provide Details:**
  When reporting a bug, include:
  - A clear and descriptive title.
  - The steps to reproduce the issue.
  - The expected and actual behavior.
  - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets.

### Feature Requests

- **Discuss First:**
  Open an issue to discuss your feature idea before submitting a pull request. This helps avoid duplication and aligns the request with our project roadmap.
- **Detail Your Idea:**
  Describe your proposed feature, its benefits to the project, and any design ideas or examples that illustrate its usage.

### Pull Requests

- **Fork and Clone:**
  Fork the repository, clone your fork locally, and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
- **Follow Coding Standards:**
  Adhere to our coding style and document your code where necessary (see Code Style below).
- **Write Tests:**
  Ensure that your changes are covered by unit tests and, if applicable, end-to-end tests.
- **Documentation:**
  Update or add documentation (README, API docs, ROADMAP, etc.) to reflect your changes.
- **Submit a Pull Request:**
  Create a pull request with a clear title and description. Reference the relevant issue(s) in your PR description.

## Coding Standards and Workflow

### Branching and Workflow

- We follow a GitFlow-inspired development process:
  - **Feature Branches:** For new features or bug fixes, create a branch from the main branch (e.g., `feature/your-feature`).
  - **Pull Requests:** Submit your branch as a pull request against the main branch.
  - Ensure your pull request has a clear description of the changes and references any related issues.

### Code Style and Linting

- **ESLint:**
  We use ESLint with strict rules to maintain code quality. Run:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

Fix any lint errors before submitting your code.

- **Prettier:**
  Maintain consistent code formatting. Our Prettier configuration is defined in `.prettierrc`. Run:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
- **Comments and Documentation:**
  Use JSDoc comments to document public methods and important classes. This helps maintain clarity and generate API documentation.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests:**
  We use Jest for our unit tests. Ensure that any new features are covered by appropriate tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- **End-to-End Tests:**
  We use Cypress for integration and end-to-end tests. Verify that your changes do not break the demo:
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
- **Coverage:**
  We aim for 100% coverage on core modules. Please add tests if your contribution introduces new branches or functionality.
